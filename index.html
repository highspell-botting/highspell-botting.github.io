      This hub is dedicated to reverse-engineering, understanding, and documenting the HighSpell web client—highlighting its architecture, patterns, and automation potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is not to distribute bots, but to examine and expose the mechanics that make botting much too feasible within this ecosystem. All insights provided here are intended for educational use, sourced transparently, and shared openly.

    <p>
      If you're curious about the deeper layers of game clients, or you believe systems should be questioned and understood, you're in the right place.
