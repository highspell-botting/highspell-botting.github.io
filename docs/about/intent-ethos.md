# Intent & Ethos

## Why This Exists

HighSpell's client is structurally fragile and highly automatable. This site illuminates those weaknesses.

Our goal is to educate, deconstruct, and broadcast possibility. Every insight here is available to anyone with curiosity. The difference is presentation and intentional depth.

## Who This Is For

Technically inclined individuals who seek to understand systems before building on them. Botting isn't just automation—it's observation, pattern recognition, and decision architecture.

## Terms of Service

**Using bots violates HighSpell's terms of service.** Engaging with game clients in unintended ways can result in account suspension.

This site:
- Does not distribute bots or automation scripts
- Provides educational walkthroughs and client analysis
- Shares only information observable through browser developer tools

You bear full responsibility for your actions.

## A Decentralized Archive

This project is open source. Download, fork, clone, republish. The more eyes on the code, the more pressure on Dew to face automation realities.

Let this be a mirror—not a weapon.

## Core Principles

### 1. Radical Transparency
We expose what's hidden, not hide what's exposed. Every technique shared here comes from publicly accessible information.

### 2. Educational Focus
This is a learning resource, not a tool repository. We prioritize understanding over implementation.

### 3. Responsible Disclosure
We document vulnerabilities to highlight the need for better security practices.

## What We Don't Do

- Distribute ready-to-use bot scripts
- Provide step-by-step tutorials for rule violations
- Share private or proprietary information
- Facilitate commercial exploitation

## What We Do

- Document publicly observable client behavior
- Analyze system architecture and design patterns
- Share reverse engineering methodologies
- Provide educational frameworks for understanding automation
- Foster technical discussion and learning

## The Ethical Framework

Our work operates within these boundaries:

1. **Public Information Only**: We only work with information accessible through normal browser tools
2. **Educational Intent**: Every piece of content serves to educate and inform
3. **Transparency**: Our methods and sources are always disclosed
4. **Responsibility**: We emphasize the consequences and risks of any actions

## Building Responsibly

If you choose to explore the techniques documented here:

- Understand the risks before you begin
- Test on disposable accounts if possible
- Respect rate limits and system boundaries
- Don't disrupt other players' experiences
- Accept the consequences of your actions
