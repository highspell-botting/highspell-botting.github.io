# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HighSpell Botting.

## Guiding Philosophy

This is a project of technical clarity—not operational assistance. We document, interpret, and expose—not hand-hold or distribute exploits.

All contributions must uphold the intent & ethos outlined in our [Intent & Ethos](intent-ethos.md) page. Keep the project educational, non-prescriptive, and decentralized.

## What's Encouraged

- Documenting obfuscated or hidden mechanics
- Technical breakdowns of the HighSpell client
- Modular explanations of automation principles
- Code snippets that demonstrate systems—not direct solutions
- Discourse on ethical, legal, and architectural implications
- Reverse engineering methodologies and tools
- Analysis of client-server communication patterns
- Documentation of game mechanics and systems
- Educational content about web technologies and automation

## What's Discouraged

- One-click bot scripts or automation packages
- Direct tutorials on gold-farming, PvP cheating, or monetized exploits
- Anything that prioritizes abuse or evasion over understanding
- Distribution of private or proprietary information
- Content that promotes rule violations or account suspension
- Commercial exploitation or monetization of techniques

## Tone & Content

Write for depth. Speak in frameworks and systems. Offer insight—not thoughtless instructions.

### Writing Style Guidelines

- Be thoughtful: Consider the implications and consequences
- Be educational: Focus on learning and understanding
- Be transparent: Disclose methods and sources

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

This repository operates under fair use and academic interest. By contributing, you agree not to:
- Use this project to promote illegal activity

- Harass, impersonate, or target specific community members
- Share private or proprietary information
- Facilitate commercial exploitation

You retain your intellectual property—but this project is open source. All contributions may be modified, published, and redistributed under the same license and ethos.
