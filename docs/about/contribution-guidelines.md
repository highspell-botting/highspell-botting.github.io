# 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HighSpell Botting. This project thrives on disciplined transparency.

## 📜 Guiding Philosophy

This is a project of technical clarity—not operational assistance. We document, interpret, and expose—**not hand-hold** or distribute exploits.

All contributions must uphold the **intent & ethos** outlined in our [Intent & Ethos](intent-ethos.md) page. That means keeping the project educational, non-prescriptive, and decentralized. If you're here to help others learn, build, and think—welcome.

## ✅ What's Encouraged

- Documenting obfuscated or hidden mechanics  
- Technical breakdowns of the HighSpell client  
- Modular explanations of automation principles  
- Code snippets that demonstrate systems—not direct solutions  
- Discourse on ethical, legal, and architectural implications  
- Reverse engineering methodologies and tools
- Analysis of client-server communication patterns
- Documentation of game mechanics and systems
- Educational content about web technologies and automation

## 🚫 What's Discouraged

- One-click bot scripts or automation packages   
- Direct tutorials on gold-farming, PvP cheating, or monetized exploits  
- Anything that prioritizes abuse or evasion over understanding
- Distribution of private or proprietary information
- Content that promotes rule violations or account suspension
- Commercial exploitation or monetization of techniques

## 🧠 Tone & Content

Write for depth. Speak in frameworks and systems. Offer insight—not thoughtless instructions.  
Every contribution should invite others to think critically and dig further, not simply copy-and-paste.

### Writing Style Guidelines

- **Be precise**: Use technical language accurately
- **Be curious**: Ask questions that lead to deeper understanding
- **Be thoughtful**: Consider the implications and consequences
- **Be educational**: Focus on learning and understanding
- **Be transparent**: Disclose methods and sources

## 📖 Legal & Ethical Considerations

This repository operates under fair use and academic interest. By contributing, you agree not to:
- Use this project to promote illegal activity  
- Misrepresent findings as undiscovered vulnerabilities  
- Harass, impersonate, or target specific community members  
- Share private or proprietary information
- Facilitate commercial exploitation

You retain your intellectual property—but this project is open source. All contributions may be modified, published, and redistributed under the same license and ethos.
